Pics is a React-based application that allows a user to obtain an array of objects, based on a given search term.  This application utilizes making API calls with React to obtain images and utilizes form development and using refs to access the DOM as well as introduction to CSS grid.

I designed this application to experiment with different features of React.

Key Features:

API call to Unsplash providing a randomly generated array of images based on search term.
